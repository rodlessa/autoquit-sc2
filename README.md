### Auto Quit SC2


It's been few years since i touched SC2, wrist is damage right now, so i build this little script to detect the images and derank from M2 so i could play.
Can be used for other games just switch inputs and images.

install dependencies
```
pip install pyautogui opencv-python numpy
```

then just run on terminal:

```
py .\autoq.py
```

You need to click on the Versus tab first.

### PS:
If you have issues may be with the UI time stamp which will be watching in order to find its in a game, just take a screenshot and switch with the one i'm using, i had no issues with the protoss grids so it should be fine anyways.

### PS2:
Can i get banned for this?

I dont know i just run it for 20 ish~ minutes.
